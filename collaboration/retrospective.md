# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- **Avoid delaying code reviews.** While we managed to review all pull
  requests, setting a stricter timeline for reviews could help maintain
  momentum and ensure faster feedback cycles.
- **Simplify overly complex functions.** Some functions included multiple
  checks and assertions, which made them harder to debug. Streamlining these
  functions could improve readability and maintainability.
- **Reduce reliance on asynchronous communication alone.** While GitHub
  comments worked well, occasional sync-ups could help address complex issues
  faster, especially in projects with unique edge cases.

---

## Continue Doing

- **Keep using the project board effectively.** The board was clean, concise,
  and clearly showed who was working on what, making it easy to track progress
  and ensure accountability.
- **Maintain excellent group communication.** The team was always ready to
  help each other, whether through WhatsApp, Zoom, or other channels. Regular
  meetings allowed us to share experiences, troubleshoot individual issues,
  and provide support whenever needed.
- **Continue the constructive and collaborative review process.** Even though
  each member worked on individual challenges, the group’s feedback during
  reviews was detailed and helpful, ensuring high-quality code.
- **Keep writing clear and consistent documentation.** Each coding challenge
  was well-documented, making it easier for reviewers to understand the
  purpose and functionality of the code.

---

## Start Doing

- **Work on meaningful, combined projects.** While individual coding
  challenges were great for learning, future projects should involve solving
  different parts of a larger problem as a team. This will push us to think
  creatively, write cleaner code, and integrate our work seamlessly.
- **Set higher standards for code quality.** As we tackle more complex
  projects, we’ll push each other to write cleaner, more efficient code and
  ensure thorough testing and documentation.
- **Encourage cross-functional collaboration.** By dividing tasks based on
  expertise and interest, we’ll ensure everyone contributes meaningfully while
  learning from each other’s approaches.
- **Strengthen our team relationships.** The bonds we’ve built through
  communication and collaboration have been a key strength. In future
  projects, we’ll continue to support each other, share knowledge, and grow
  together as a team.

## Lessons Learned

- **Clear documentation and testing are essential, especially with team
  support.** Well-documented code made reviews smoother, and thorough testing
  ensured reliability. When challenges arose, the team worked together to
  resolve them, such as recovering mistakenly deleted code and reverting
  merged conflicts to push clean versions.
- **Communication and collaboration are invaluable.** Regular meetings on
  Zoom and WhatsApp helped us stay connected, share experiences, and lift each
  other up. For example, when one member had fewer reviews, we assigned
  additional challenges to ensure everyone contributed equally.
- **Automated tools are a game-changer.** Using tools for linting and
  automated testing ensured consistent code quality across all challenges,
  saving time and reducing manual effort.
- **Teamwork thrives even in individual work.** While the coding challenges
  were individual, the review and documentation process required
  collaboration, which strengthened our ability to work as a team.
- **Feedback drives improvement.** Constructive reviews helped us identify
  areas for improvement and pushed us to write cleaner, more efficient code.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- **GitHub features worked seamlessly.** The project board was clean and
  concise, clearly showing who was working on what, and pull requests were
  well-organized and labeled.
- **CI/CD tools performed as expected.** Automated tools ensured consistent
  code quality across most challenges.
- **The review process was effective.** Even though the coding challenges were
  individual, the group’s feedback during reviews was detailed and
  constructive, ensuring high-quality code.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- **Uneven workload distribution.** Some members had fewer reviews initially,
  but we addressed this by assigning additional challenges to ensure everyone
  contributed equally.
- **Issues with formatting checks.** While most CI/CD checks worked well, one
  formatting check failed in recent codes, even though the code appeared clean
  locally. Despite efforts to resolve it, the issue persisted, highlighting a
  gap in our CI/CD setup.

### Did you need to add things that weren’t in your strategy?

- **Added more structured communication.** While asynchronous communication
  worked well, we introduced regular Zoom meetings to address complex issues
  and ensure everyone was on the same page.
- **Assigned additional reviews to balance workloads.** When we noticed some
  members had fewer reviews, we added new challenges to ensure everyone
  participated equally.

### Or remove extra steps?

- **Streamlined documentation.** While thorough documentation was important,
  we avoided over-documenting to keep reviews focused and efficient.
- **Reduced reliance on lengthy meetings.** Instead of frequent long meetings,
  we used quick sync-ups and WhatsApp messages to address issues promptly.

## Conclusion

This project was a valuable learning experience for our team. While each
member worked on individual coding challenges, the collaborative
aspects—reviewing, documenting, and supporting each other—helped us grow both
technically and as a team.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Clear documentation and testing are essential.** They not only make code
   easier to understand but also ensure reliability and maintainability.
2. **Communication and collaboration are the backbone of success.** Tools like
   WhatsApp and Zoom kept us connected, and regular meetings helped us address
   challenges and share knowledge.
3. **Automated tools are game-changers.** They ensured consistent code
   quality, though we learned the importance of keeping these tools updated
   and properly configured.
4. **Teamwork thrives even in individual work.** By supporting each other
   through reviews, feedback, and problem-solving, we strengthened our ability
   to work as a cohesive unit.

**Looking Ahead:**
In future projects, we aim to tackle more meaningful, combined challenges
where each member contributes to a larger goal. We’ll continue to push each
other to write cleaner, more efficient code, maintain strong communication,
and build on the bonds we’ve formed.

This project has set a strong foundation for our growth, and we’re excited to
take on bigger challenges together.
