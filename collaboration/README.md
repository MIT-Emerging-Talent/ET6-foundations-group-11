# Group Norms

These are rules we abide by as a team. It is a living document and hence can be updated
to reflect the current situation. It's important that team members revisit it frequently.

## How we build and maintain cognitive and affective trust?

- Pay attention when the next person is speaking - conveys a feeling of being respected
  and heard
- Address the project, not the person - creates a safe environment for achieving
  common project goal

## What we do if that trust is broken

- Address it by talking it over with the person who broke it.
- Involve a third-party team member if still not addressed.
- If a sincere apology is given, accept it, and reset mindset to assuming the team
  has positive intentions for everyone.
- If the trust cannot be repaired, reach out to program staff to have you removed
  from the situation.

## How we balance discussions vs debate. When is one more appropriate than the other?

- We may debate over which programming language to use or how a function is
  written. Secondly, we may debate over meeting time or places. Debates are healthy
  and inevitable, but discussions MUST follow afterward.
- Discussion: it is important for discussion to always follow a debate. This is
  when everyone articulates their thoughts on why they disagree or agree, and a
  consensus is reached. If a consensus cannot be reached, then the object of
  disagreement should be put up for a vote.
- Aside from contentious issues as laid out above,
  the team should be able to discuss things
  normally and agree on what works for everyone.

## How the team approaches meeting times and agendas

- This is currently up for vote. Check back for final update.

## How and where the team communicates about different aspects of the project?

- Slack and Whatsapp are the two major means of communication for the team.

## Team's Respect Codes

- Attend Meetings. If you will be unable to make it, please communicate that beforehand.
- Pay attention when someone is speaking. Don't cut them off unnecessarily.
- Do not shout at the top of your voice during debates. Take turns to disagree calmly.
- Avoid assumptions. When in doubt, ask for clarity.

## Extras

- Always do a "git pull origin main" whenever you start working on the group repository
  locally.
- Always checkout to a git branch named after the task you are working on.
- Always push directly from your branch to the remote repository, then create a
  pull request.
- Always delete the branch after it has been merged to main.
