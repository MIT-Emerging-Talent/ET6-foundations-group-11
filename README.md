# MIT Emerging Talent: ET6-Foundation Group BugSquashers code Review Exercise

## Overview

This repository is part of the **MIT Emerging Talent Program**, where
**Group BugSquashers** collaborated to complete and review coding challenges.
The goal of
this exercise was to develop proficiency in using **GitHub** for code review,
project management, and ensuring code quality with **CI/CD tools**. Through this
project, we aimed to enhance both our technical and collaborative skills,
preparing us for future group projects within the program.

## Objectives

- Successfully collaborate in a shared repository environment.
- Push **2+ completed coding challenges**, each with:
  - Proper documentation.
  - Comprehensive unit tests.
- Review **2+ solutions** submitted by classmates.
- Practice using GitHub features for:
  - Branching and pull requests.
  - Code review and discussion.
  - CI/CD integration and issue management.
- Complete a **retrospective** to reflect on our collaborative efforts.

## Deliverables

### 1. Coding Challenges

- Each group member contributed at least **two solutions**.
- Each solution includes:
  - Well-documented code with clear explanations.
  - Unit tests to ensure correctness and handle edge cases.
- Coding challenges were pushed for **different issues**, ensuring clear task
separation and organization.

### 2. Code Reviews

- Each group member reviewed **2+ pull requests**.
- Reviews were constructive and followed the **Code Review Checklist**.
- All pull requests were labeled appropriately and merged only after approval.

### 3. Collaboration Documents

- We completed a **Collaboration Retrospective** to reflect on our teamwork.
- Each team member outlined their **Learning Goals** for the project.

### 4. Project Board

- We tracked issues and pull requests using labels for easy navigation.
- The board was updated regularly to reflect our progress.

## Code Review Checklist

When reviewing pull requests, we ensured:

### Documentation

- Code had proper docstring and comments explaining its purpose.
- Files and functions were named appropriately.

### Testing

- Unit tests covered all edge cases.
- All tests passed in the CI pipeline.

### Code Quality

- Code followed Python coding standards (**PEP 8**).
- Code was clean, readable, and free of unused imports or variables.

### Collaboration

- Review comments were constructive and positive.
- Failing CI checks were discussed and resolved.

## Branch Naming Conventions

To keep the repository organized, we followed these branch naming conventions:

- `feature/<feature-name>`: For new features or solutions.
- `bugfix/<bug-description>`: For fixing bugs.
- `docs/<documentation-update>`: For updating documentation.
- `review/<code-review>`: For changes related to code reviews.

## CI/CD Integration

We used automated tools to maintain code quality:

- **Ruff** for linting and formatting.
- Automated unit testing pipelines to verify code correctness.
- Pull requests were only merged after passing all CI checks, or failing checks
were discussed during review.

## Retrospective

At the end of the project, we completed a **Collaboration Retrospective**
to reflect on:

1. **What went well?**
2. **What could be improved?**
3. **Actionable steps for future collaborations.**

## How to Contribute

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone

2. **Create a new branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<your-feature-name>
   ```

3. **Push your changes and create a pull request.**

4. **Review at least two pull requests from your teammates.**

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed as part of the MIT Emerging Talent Program, and weâ€™re
grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow together. Special thanks to our
instructors and peers for their guidance, support, and collaboration throughout
this journey.

## Additional Notes

- **Coding Challenges and Issues:**  
  Each coding challenge was associated with a specific issue on the project
  board. This approach helped us organize tasks, track progress, and ensure that
  all challenges were addressed systematically. By linking pull requests to
  their respective issues, we maintained clarity and transparency throughout the
  project
